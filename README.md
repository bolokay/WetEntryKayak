# WetEntryKayak
Class project for 4363 
FinalProjectGui.Zip is most current version of application

The purpose of this windows form application is to mimic the experience of purchasing a kayak from a kayak website, along with inventory/employee management
when entering the correct creditials. The application interacts with a Microsoft SQL server database in order to send/pull data about inventory/employees/customer info/etc.

Some aspects of data insertion had to be manually implemented in the application itself due to incorrect formatting in some of the database tables, including having to assign primary key's instead of auto incrementing in the database

This application will most likely cease to function as the database it draws from gets overwritten
